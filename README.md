Based on an ImageJ macro published in Nature protocols paper: 
“Quantitative imaging of membrane lipid order in cells and organisms” , 
Owen et al, 2011. doi:10.1038/nprot.2011.419

This macro calculates GP images from Laurdan and di-4-ANEPPDHQ ratiometric images in
bactch mode (whole chosen folder) obtained using a Leica microscope. The generation
of HSB images of these GP images has been also implemented.
